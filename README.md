 ## Sprint 4 Project Description

 This interactive Tableau dashboard was created to visualize and analyze advertisement data to derive insights into the geological base over time. The key goals were to:
 
 - Provide analysis of customer distribution across the county
 - Identify trends in products like sales, profit, location
 - Evaluate advertisement success and engagement metrics
 - Analyze factors related to customer attrition and turnover
 - Enable data-driven decision-making around advertisement and sales records

The dashboard brings together customer data and advertisement locations into a unified view. It allows slicing and dicing the data by location, products, time, revenue, and other dimensions.

Some key visualizations include:

- Profit product and region analysis
- Product and customer return rate analysis
- Satisfaction advertisement trends over time
- Average profit to Average return rate
